                A Memokeeper from the Garden of Recollection. 
                A mysterious and elegant soothsayer
                
                Bears a warm smile and is willing to patiently heed the
                words of another, and thus uses such means as a pretext 
                to enter "memories" and gain a comprehension over the 
                flow of all information. Feels strongly about collecting
                unique memories, yet the thoughts that guide her are 
                hard to glean.

            "I arrived on this planet as an
            explorer. My usual tasks 
            involved observing the flow of
            rivers, examining the 
            materials of the city's bricks 
            and tiles, analyzing the 
            steepness of roads, and 
            documenting the number and 
            distribution of chimneys... 
            These duties aligned with
            people's imagination of
            preserving a planet's
            'memories.'"

            "She's quite an unusual kid, and I could 
            sense it from the day she was born. It felt 
            like nature itself was celebrating her arrival:
            The birds chirped, the moon and sun were
            together in the sky. The cards in my hand
            seemed to hint at the emergence of a soul 
            steeped in nostalgia. Right from her early
            years, she had a fascination with stories 
            from the past. She would delve deep into
            contemplating our origins, our creators,
            and even the very beginning of the world.
            Her questions would leave even the most
            erudite scholars scratching their heads.
            Sure, some other kids might poke fun at 
            her for asking such deep questions, but 
            aren't those questions important? Life is 
            akin to a winding labyrinth, where memories
            serve as our sole companions."
